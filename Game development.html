            <p>My love for game development started recently, I always 
                played video games but never knew how to create them 
                (Still somehow don't but I'm getting there). After enrolling into
                Dalhousie, I've found video games 10x more fun knowing how
                much effort and creativity goes into it. Hopefully soon, I will
                dive into creating my own full game with animations and all
                sorts of stuff, but as of right now, I'm still learning languages 
                and improving my coding skills.</p>

            <p>These 3 companies are my favorite video game developers. These 
                developers created so many memories for me that it's hard to 
                value. Raven and Treyarch created almost all of the BO AND MW 
                series and Sony created way too many games, but my favorite is their
                Spider-Man series.</p>
